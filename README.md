# Combine_PDFs
Straightforward Python script to combine PDFs.

Simply drop the .py file into the folder where the PDFs you want to combine are, and open!

The PDFs will be merged in alphabetical order (by file name) and saved into a new PDF - 'output.pdf' - in the same folder as the .py file (and the source PDFs).
